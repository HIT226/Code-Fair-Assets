# Client Recommendations

This list of recommendations is based on an email chain with the client and is presented here as a way to distribute this information to groups undertaking the Code Fair Project.

These recommendations are a straight copy & paste from the email, some of what is recommended here is beyond the scope of this unit. It is up to you to interpret and make decisions within your group based on this client communication. As always, successfully achieving goals beyond the scope of the unit are worth Innovation marks 

## Client recommendations for the dynamic part of the website

- All students can submit their expression of interest for the competitions through the web site- They should be able to create an account for themselves in the website and then have the options to submit their EOI in one more competitions online(this step should ask the minimum amount of information from students since this is only an expression of interest).
- After submitting their expression of interest in the website, a link to the selected competition(s) registration form(s) should be automatically send to the student email address from the website. In addition, I think the Google Forms are not professional enough for the code fair so if we can design the forms inside of our website, it will look more professional.
- We need a mechanism for reminding the interested students to submit their registration forms by the deadline. For example, our website should send a reminder email or preferably SMS to students once a week/ once a fortnight, after they submit their EOI until they submit their registration forms. online.
- We also need a same mechanism as above to remind students to submit their project display cards by the deadline.
- We need an admin control panel in our website to set some variables such as : deadlines for submitting EOI, registration and submitting project info cards ,set intervals for reminders, create reports against submitted applications and user management (password recovery etc)
- Each registered student should have access to their profile in our website to see their competition progress status in each category. The status can be something like : No Action Yet/ EOI received| Registration form received| Project Info card/Bio card received| Assessing the competition level | Finalized  …)
- If a student wins a competition, he/she should have access to download their electronic certificate from the website by login in to their accounts.

## Client recommendations for the static part of the website

- Having a photo gallery for each previous years
- Having a FAQ section for students. I can prepare the questions and answers for this part if you like.
- Having all of the competition details and prizes
- Having sponsors Logos
- Having an IT Code Fair progress bar on the home page to show the current status of the fair. For example: Sending Invitations for students à Receiving EOI from Students à Receiving Projects from Students à finalizing judges list and etc.
- Having a category for winners. So we can have all the winners details including their photo and names from all the previous years.
- Having a link to a live video broadcasting for the Code Fair for out of the campus guests.
